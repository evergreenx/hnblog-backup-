I decided to write this guide cause when I started learning framer motion I encountered a significant challenge â€” the scarcity of comprehensive learning materials. much of my learning relied heavily on sifting through documentation, leaving me craving more accessible and practical resources.

Before we get into the resources, let's first understand what framer motion is.

Framer Motion is a production-ready animation library that empowers developers like me to create stunning and seamless animations within our React projects.

As a [React](https://react.dev/) developer, you definitely will need framer motion at one point or the other. The majority of articles and videos found online are outdated or no longer aligned with the latest updates.
