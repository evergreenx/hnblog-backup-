React 18 is the next major release of React that was expected to be released in 2019. There are many new features and improvements in this version of React, including a brand new experimental API called Suspense that will make it easier to build interactive and high-performance web applications.

It is important to know that there are no breaking changes in this version of React and you can upgrade to React 18 without any problems. The only thing you need to do when upgrading from React 18 is to update your package dependencies. So we will be upgrading an existing react application to react 18.

# Prerequisites

* Node 14+ or higher installed on your local machine.
    
* any text editor of choice.
    
* get your APP\_ID and API\_KEY from [Edaman api](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api).
    

# Let's get started

This is the GitHub repo containing our react project. [https://github.com/evergreenx/Recipe-Search](https://github.com/evergreenx/Recipe-Search) you could clone the project

```plaintext
git clone git@github.com:evergreenx/Recipe-Search.git
```

after cloning the project, create a .env file and add your API key gotten from [Edaman](https://www.edamam.com/)

```javascript
REACT_APP_API_ID = 'your API ID'
REACT_APP_API_KEY= 'your API key'
```

then open the project directory in your IDE of choice run the command to install the project dependencies.

```javascript
npm install
or 
yarn install
```

after installing the node modules

run the project

```javascript
npm run start

or

yarn start
```

you should see a page like this

if you check the package.json file this project was created with react 17.0.1.

```plaintext
"dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.11.6",
    "@testing-library/react": "^11.2.2",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^12.2.2",
    "react": "^17.0.1",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.1",
    "react-scripts": "4.0.1",
    "web-vitals": "^0.2.4"
  },
```

we are going to update the project to react 18.

first off run the command to install the latest version of react and react-dom.

```plaintext
npm install react@latest  react-dom@latest

or

yarn add react@latest  react-dom@latest
```

if everything works out fine you should get updated dependencies looking like this.

```plaintext
 "dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.11.6",
    "@testing-library/react": "^11.2.2",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^12.2.2",
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "react-scripts": "4.0.1",
    "web-vitals": "^0.2.4"
  },
```

Hurray ðŸ¥³ ðŸ¥³ ðŸ¥³ . We just updated the react version to the latest. Now we aren't finally done. if you check your console you should get this error.

So basically react 18 introduces a new root API that makes managing roots easier.

open the index.js file, import the new root API

```plaintext
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
```

replace this part of the `index.js` too

```plaintext
// Before
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

// After
const container = document.getElementById("root");
const root = createRoot(container);
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />{" "}
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

# Conclusion

We were able to upgrade the project to react 18 without issues, so you could use the same steps to upgrade other projects.
